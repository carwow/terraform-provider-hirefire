Development
---

    go build .

Then create a `main.tf` file and use Terraform as usual to experiment.


Testing
---

    go test -v ./...

In order to run Terraform acceptance tests which will create **real** resources
then create an `.env` file with:

    TF_ACC=on
    HIREFIRE_API_KEY=your-key
    # The following variables are optional.
    # For user data source:
    HIREFIRE_TEST_USER_ID=user-id
    HIREFIRE_TEST_USER_EMAIL=user-email
    # For membership resource:
    HIREFIRE_TEST_MEMBERSHIP_USER_ID=another-user-id

and run with:

    env $(cat .env) go test -v ./...

or to run tests for a single resource:

    env $(cat .env) go test -v ./resources/application
